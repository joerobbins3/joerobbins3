<h2>Frederico Garcia Lorca</h2>
<p>"So, then, the duende is a force not a labour, a struggle not a thought. <br>
heard an old maestro of the guitar say: ‘The duende is not in the throat: <br> 
duende surges up, inside, from the soles of the feet.’ Meaning, it’s not a <br> 
question of skill, but of a style that’s truly alive: meaning, it’s in the <br>
veins: meaning, it’s of the most ancient culture of immediate creation."</p>
